# Beefsteak Reverse Sear
by Eric Goetschalckx

### Instructions
Pre-heat oven to 225 deg F

Season steak on all 6 sides

Insert thermometer probe

Place steak on a wire rack on an oven pan

Roast in oven to 95 deg F

Pre-heat cast iron pan with oil on stove

For Medium Rare aim for 120 deg F in cast iron pan

Transfer from cast iron pan to tray and cover in aluminum foil

Steak rests

Final temp 125 deg F = medium rare

### Tips

I use a [ThermoWorks BlueDOT](https://www.thermoworks.com/BlueDOT)

For seasonings I use coarse Himalayan pink salt, paprika, and garlic powder

Pre-mixed steak seasnonigs work great as well

Leave the probe in as long as you can so you can monitor progress, including while searing and resting

Cover oven pan in foil for easier cleanup

I use olive oil for the cast iron, but other oils work too

Aim for 120 deg F final temp for rare

Its safer to go further in the oven than further in the pan

If seasoning begins to char in the cast iron pan, flip

Multiple flips in the pan is fine

Checking meat firmness while searing will help you identify target temps for future steaks or when you dont have your thermometer

Good Luck
