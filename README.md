### Instructions

- Pre-heat oven to 225 deg F
- Season steak on all 6 sides
- Insert thermometer probe
- Place steak on a wire rack on an oven pan
- Roast in oven to 95 deg F
- Pre-heat cast iron pan with oil on stove
- For Medium Rare aim for 120 deg F in cast iron pan
- Transfer from cast iron pan to tray and cover in aluminum foil
- Steak rests
- Final temp 125 deg F = medium rare

### Tips

- Your steak should be at least 1 inch thick, preferably 1 Â½ inches
- I use a [ThermoWorks BlueDOT](https://www.thermoworks.com/BlueDOT)
- For seasonings I use coarse Himalayan pink salt, paprika, and garlic powder
- Pre-mixed steak seasonings work great as well
- Leave the probe in as long as possible so you can monitor progress, including while searing and resting
- Cover oven pan in foil for easier cleanup
- I use olive oil for the cast iron, but other oils work too
- Aim for 120 deg F final temp for rare, after resting
- Its safer to go further in the oven than further in the pan
- If seasoning begins to char in the cast iron pan, flip the steak
- Multiple flips in the pan is fine
- Checking meat firmness while searing will help you identify target temps for future steaks or when you dont have your thermometer

Good Luck!
